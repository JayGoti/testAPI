	"body":"Portugal and Manchester United star striker Cristiano Ronaldo revealed that he was close to signing for bitter rivals Manchester City last year, but former manager Sir Alex Ferguson asked him not to. Ronaldo said Ferguson persuaded him to re-join United, who have not won a league title since the former's retirement in 2013. Ronaldo re-joined United from Juventus, penning a two-year deal. During his first spell with the club, Ronaldo won eight major trophies, including three Premier League and one Champions League triumph. 'Well, honestly, it was close... It's something they spoke [about] a lot and [Manchester City manager Pep] Guardiola said two weeks ago, I guess, that they tried hard to have me,' Ronaldo said on Piers Morgan Uncensored."

	"body":"It is 7:00 am in Dubai and as the sun peeks above high-rises, it reveals an animated scene below: about 200 people, mostly men, wielding bats and taped-up tennis balls in a weekly festival of street cricket. About a dozen informal games are in progress in a carpark near the city's financial district, as metro trains glide across a bridge overhead and police watch from a parked SUV, wary of players bringing alcohol or otherwise misbehaving. Every weekend, such games are played on spare patches of ground across the Gulf region, which is home to millions of migrant workers and expatriates from cricket-loving South Asia. \n\nAnd even as the Gulf, namely Qatar, gears up to host the first football World Cup on Arab soil, another tournament dominated conversation among the players in Dubai: cricket's Twenty20 World Cup, which was unfolding in Australia."

Kosovan powerhouse Vedat Muriqi's 16th-minute strike was enough to inflict a fourth league defeat of the season on Diego Simeone's visitors, who are 13 points behind leaders Barcelona. Atletico, knocked out of the Champions League, are winless in five games and at their lowest ebb since Simeone arrived in December 2011. 'It's good that the league is stopping, it will generate a bit more calm for us to be able to work,' Simeone told DAZN. 'I hope that after the World Cup we can go with the idea of turning this situation around.' Meanwhile Real Sociedad moved third with a 2-1 win at struggling Sevilla, who had two men sent off in the first half. With Atletico's defence in disarray, the persistent Muriqi sent Mallorca ahead, finishing from close range for his eighth league goal of the season, meaning only Barcelona striker Robert Lewandowski has scored more in La Liga. Alvaro Morata thought he had put Atletico level with a sharp finish moments later but the forward was marginally offside and the goal was disallowed. Atletico created nothing of note after that, while at the other end the silky Lee Kang-in caused problems, while Muriqi remained a menace. The striker set up Amath Ndiaye on the break towards the end but Jan Oblak produced a fine save to deny the Senegalese winger. Mallorca goalkeeper Predrag Rajkovic made a stunning reaction save to deny Morata near the end as Atletico tried and failed to salvage even a point. Axel Witsel's 95th-minute overhead kick looked like it could fly in but Rodrigo Battaglia headed it to safety in a thrilling finale, with the home side celebrating a rise to 10th. 'I have gained a lot of confidence here, when I arrived at Mallorca I knew that it was my last chance,' journeyman forward Muriqi, 28, told DAZN. 'I have done nothing to be an idol yet, I want them to see me as a (Samuel) Eto'o, or a (Dani) Guiza.' Real deal Jorge Sampaoli's Sevilla, 17th, were unable to build on their derby point at the weekend and red cards for Ivan Rakitic and Tanguy Nianzou gave them an uphill struggle against Real Sociedad at a frustrated Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan. Alexander Sorloth sent Real Sociedad ahead in the 20th minute with a well-measured chip over goalkeeper Bono after being fed by Mikel Merino. Alex Remiro made a sublime save at full stretch to stop Isco from equalising, but after that Sevilla became their own worst enemy. Rakitic and Nianzou were both sent off for ugly challenges on Brais Mendez, just six minutes apart. Mendez punished Sevilla further by tucking home the second goal after another perfectly-weighted through-ball from Merino. However Rafa Mir nodded Alex Telles's cross past Remiro before the break to give his team a glimmer of hope, despite their numerical disadvantage. Sorloth missed from point blank range after Bono deflected David Silva's low shot into his path at an awkward height.Sevilla stayed in the game but could not find an equaliser and also remain without a single win at home this season in the top flight.'The situation is worrying, we will have to sit down with the club to see if we can solve this together,' said Sampaoli, who has only managed two wins from 10 games since being appointed in October.'We need better players who can get at opponents, and solidity in some areas. We will see if we can do it with these players, or if some will arrive.'Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.comElsewhere Quique Setien earned his first win as Villarreal manager with a narrow 1-0 triumph at Espanyol, while Almeria beat Getafe by the same score.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)"
